# Apollo
File sharing, everyone.

Apollo is built to enable file sharing from any device to another
using directly without an intermediary, meaning it's entirely secure
and is only visible to you.

Built using Electron and React, Apollo brings a snappy and feature rich experience
to file sharing.

Despite still being in early development, I have been able to send multiple files across my two PC's and this show promise towards an alpha release.
